# Model for forecasting BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Société Générale prices using ARIMA  
to applied the ARIMA models (autoregressive integrated moving average) in order to predict future values, we data need need to show evidence of non-stationarity in the sense of mean (but not variance/autocovariance), where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the "integrated" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity of the mean function (the trend).
