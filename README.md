# Price forecasting models for BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Générale  
Within this repo, my goal is to make forecasts with the best model adapted to my data.  
Coming from a master's degree in finance, I have had courses in econometrics during my studies and my interest in this field is growing as I start using it in personal projects.     

**If anyone sees any errors in my code or a better model for predicting this data, please contact me or comment.**   
I just started analyzing data on Jupyter notebook and am eager to learn more.
