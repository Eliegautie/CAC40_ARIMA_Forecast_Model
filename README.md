# Model for forecasting BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Société Générale prices using ARIMA  
As predictable, it's not as easy to predict stock value. I currently stop my model when i find out that the ACF show no srong evidence of correlation for the three values.  
If anyone sees any errors in my code or a better model for predicting this data, please contact me or comment.   
I just started analyzing data on Jupyter notebook and am eager to learn more.
