# Price forecasting models:

AutoRegressive Model:

-The AR model is simply an extension of the random walk that includes terms further back in time. 
**The structure of the model is linear, that is the model depends linearly on the previous terms, with coefficients for each term**. This is where the "regressive" comes from in "autoregressive". It is essentially a regression model where the previous terms are the predictors.

- the mean of a AR(p) process is 0
- AR(1) = random walk


MovingAverage Model:

-**It is a linear combination of the past white noise terms**.
